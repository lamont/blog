## Welcome to a random collection of my thoughts

I'm just experimenting, wanted to use Jekyll, then figured out GitHub Pages would let me play with it for free.

You can always view the [source](https://github.com/lamont/blog/) used to build this site via markdown.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lamont/blog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
